Hadoop

NameNode
- runs on master machine
- monitor, manage or maintain data node
- it stores the metadata
- it regularly recieves heartbeat from data node

DataNode
- runs on slave machine
- it stores actual business logic/data
- it serves read and write request from user
- after every 3 seconds it sends heartbeat to namenode

=========================================
Hadoop Architecture
- Data will be processed in slave machines
- File will be split into blocks (128mb max size each)
- Each block is replicated 3 times (replication factor)
- Each replication for a particular block is written in a seperate slave machine

=========================================

HDFS - Hadoop distributed file system
- primary storage system of hadoop
- it runs on commodity hardware
- this is default big data storage layer of apache hadoop
- hadoop directly interacts with HDFS through shell commands
- distributed data will be processed parallely

========================================

Task of HDFS DataNode
- NameNode, DataNode, Secondary NameNode

Secondary Namenode :
Namenode stores metadata like file system namespace information
Namenode stores info in 2 file :
- fsImage - Snapshot of the file system, stores info like modification, access time, permission, replication
- Edit logs - stores the activities/transactions being performed on HDFS
=====================================

File I/O in HDFS
- Write Once Read Many models
