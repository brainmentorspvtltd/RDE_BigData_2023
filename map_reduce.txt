Hadoop
- HDFS (Storage)
- MR - MapReduce (Processing)
- YARN - Processing
==============================

Problems before MapReduce
- Critical Path problem
- Reliability Problem
- Equal Split issue
- Single Split may fail
- Aggregation of result

MapReduce
- it is build to process huge amount of data in parallel by dividing it into independent task
- we get input from a list and converts it into output which is also a list

Map - Business logic. convert input into key-value pair
Reduce - takes input from map. Applies aggregation on key-value pair

Map task - (Split and Mapping)
Reduce task - (Shuffling and reducing)


Job Tracker - Master (responsible for complete execution of submitted job)
MultipleTask Tracker - Slave (each of them performing there jobs)
